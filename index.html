<p class="sectionSubTag text-sm">There are so many teens in America struggling with depression, and suicidial thoughts, and all too frequently acting on those those thoughts. As a parent who's own child has struggled with these issues, I know all too well the hurt this disease can bring. I want Children to know there is help out there for them ,and that they are never alone. I want to give parents the knowledge they need to help their children through these very dark, and difficult times in their lives. No Child should ever feel so alone that they want to take their own life. My hope is that with every little bit of awareness we raise, the suicide rates will begin to drop!</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-sm">Sources from the Atlantic University Schmidt college of medicine have shown that since 1999 to 2018 suicide rates in adolescents ages 13-14 have more than doubled. Its is now the leading cause of death in teens ages 13-24. The American Pshycological Association's study shows that at least 20% of teens have seriously considered committing suicide. Researchers are also finding that suicides are spiking during the school year, and dropping off in the summer. This suggests that there are many factors such as, bullying, acedemic pressure, and other school stress that are becoming factors. These are things we can pay attention to, and use to help us make a difference!</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-sm">We all need to know the signs and symptoms of one of our childen suffering from suicidal tendencies. Paying attention to difference in behavior, and behavioral changes are huge. Being depressed, frustrated, and isolating from the family are all signs of depression, and could lead to suicidal thoughts or actions. Remember when we are under strain our children feel it too, so we should try not to let them feel our frustration with any situation. Always let them know you're there to talk to, and if they don't want to open up to you offer them someone else to talk to. Look for signs of self-harm such as cutting. Our children need to know we care, and that they are never alone! </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-sm">My hopes with this website is that I can help parents and caregivers alike to recognize the symptoms that will lead to suicide attempts. Having dealt with a child that has suffered from these issues it is truly heartbreaking to watch your child go through the emotional pain, and the hopelessness that stems from this disease. I want to give you the knowledge to see the signs, and the resources to help your child deal with these demons that haunt their life. If I can save even one child from taking their life, I feel I have completed my mission.</p>
